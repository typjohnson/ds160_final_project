# ds160_final_project
This project aims to investigate the effects of an earthquake on a building based on data collected from the 2015 earthquake in Nepal, focusing on the building and land characteristics that may have an impact on whether or not a building can withstand an earthquake. Using a logistic regression, a model will be created that aims to predict the outcome of a building after an earthquake. The findings indicate that regardless of characteristics, being in the area of impact means the building was most likely destryoed. The model was able to predict the outcome of an earthquake with 86% accuracy, though bias towards a destroyed outcome may play a part in this. It can be suggested that the factors included in the dataset are not enough to predict the outcome of an earthquake and more will be needed in order to truly understand how a building can withstand an earthquake.
